## Project Overview

"One Strand of the Sea" is an interactive installation artwork that explores human connection through technology. When two participants place their hands on the installation simultaneously, it creates a visual representation of their connection through rippling lights, mirroring the motion of waves and illuminating their faces.

### Concept
The artwork is inspired by the artist's personal experience of migration from Korea to New York, where technology—particularly a MacBook—served as a vital bridge to maintain connections with family and friends. The installation, shaped like a MacBook, symbolizes both a device of connectivity and a personal icon of maintaining relationships across vast distances.

The title "One Strand of the Sea" metaphorically represents the delicate yet powerful thread that connects people across great distances, like a single strand spanning an ocean. Through this work, audiences are invited to reflect on their own bonds and the technological mediums that facilitate these connections.
